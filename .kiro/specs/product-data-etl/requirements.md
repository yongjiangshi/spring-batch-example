# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a multi-step Spring Batch ETL pipeline that demonstrates advanced batch processing capabilities. The system will first import product data from a CSV file into a database, then process and filter that data to generate a sales report as a new CSV file. This serves as a comprehensive learning example for Spring Batch, showcasing file-to-database and database-to-file operations within a single job.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a software developer learning Spring Batch, I want to set up a Spring Boot project with proper batch processing dependencies, so that I can build complex multi-step batch jobs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include spring-boot-starter-batch, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, and h2database dependencies
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use H2 in-memory database for easy testing and development
3. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL automatically create a PRODUCTS table with id, name, description, and price fields using schema.sql

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define a multi-step batch job, so that I can orchestrate complex data processing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the batch configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL define a Job named "productEtlJob"
2. WHEN the job executes THEN the system SHALL run two steps in sequence: "step1_loadCsvToDb" followed by "step2_generateReportFromDb"
3. IF step1 fails THEN the system SHALL NOT execute step2
4. WHEN both steps complete successfully THEN the system SHALL mark the job as completed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to import product data from CSV to database, so that I can learn file-based input processing with database output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN step1 starts THEN the system SHALL read from a products.csv file containing at least 10 product records
2. WHEN reading CSV data THEN the system SHALL map each row to a Product JPA entity with id, name, description, and price fields
3. WHEN processing items THEN the system SHALL optionally transform data (such as adding an importDate field)
4. WHEN writing data THEN the system SHALL use JpaItemWriter to batch insert Product entities into the PRODUCTS table
5. WHEN step1 completes THEN the PRODUCTS table SHALL contain all data from the CSV file

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate filtered reports from database data, so that I can learn database-based input processing with file output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN step2 starts THEN the system SHALL read Product entities from the PRODUCTS table using JpaPagingItemReader
2. WHEN processing items THEN the system SHALL filter products with price greater than 50
3. WHEN processing filtered items THEN the system SHALL transform Product entities to SalesReport DTO objects
4. WHEN writing report data THEN the system SHALL use FlatFileItemWriter to create sales_report.csv with columns: productId, productName, price
5. WHEN step2 completes THEN the sales_report.csv file SHALL exist in the project root directory
6. WHEN examining the report file THEN it SHALL contain only products with price greater than 50

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot batch job execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN a step fails THEN the system SHALL stop job execution and mark the job as failed
3. WHEN the job runs THEN the system SHALL provide progress information for each step
4. WHEN the job completes THEN the system SHALL log summary statistics including items read, processed, and written
